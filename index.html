            <p class="address">Henlo Tangi, it's our second month of being officially dating. I really don't know what to say anymore po kasi I already wrote it on a bunch of letters.</p>
            <p class="lig">We've been a lot of arguments and stuff, you also let me witness your vulnerable side. It made me think na I really should keep you and handle you with more care. I may not say this enough but thank you for being there for me. Thank you for being my daily dose of happiness. I love you so much, tangi.</p>
            <p class="occupation">I just want you to know that I love you so much and I'm always here for you no matter what. I'll be with you through ups and downs, kasi kakampi mo ako. Kasama mo ko sa lahat, hirang.</p>
            <p class="aya">Mahal kita, Ligaya. I never thought that love would be this gentle, thank you for loving me in the most gentle way. I may not promise to be perfect but I swear that I'll give you my all.</p>
